          <!-- Early life ------------------------------------------------------->
          <h1>Early life</h1>
          <p>Margaret Heafield was born in <a>Paoli, Indiana</a> to Kenneth Heafield and
            Ruth Esther Heafield (née Partington).<em class="index"><a>[5]</a></em> After graduating from
            Hancock High School in 1954, she started out in mathematics at the
            University of Michigan and earned a B.A. in mathematics with a minor in
            philosophy from <a>Earlham College</a> in 1958.<em class="index"><a>[6]</a></em><em class="index"><a>[7]</a></em> She briefly taught high school mathematics and French upon
            graduation, in order to support her husband while he worked on his undergraduate degree at Harvard,
            with the ultimate goal of pursuing a graduate degree at a later time. She moved to <a>Boston,
            Massachusetts</a> with the intention of doing graduate study in <a>abstract mathematics</a> at <a>Brandeis University</a>.
            In 1960 she took an interim position at <a>MIT</a> to develop software for predicting weather on the <a>LGP-30</a> and the
            <a>PDP-1</a> computers (at <a>Marvin Minsky's</a> <a>Project MAC</a>) for professor <a>Edward Norton Lorenz</a> in the <a>meteorology</a>
            department.<em class="index"><a>[8]</a></em><em class="index"><a>[1]</a></em><em class="index"><a>[9]</a></em> Hamilton wrote that at that time, computer science and software engineering were not yet
             disciplines; instead, programmers learned on the job with hands-on experience.<em class="index"><a>[3]</a></em></p>
          <p>From 1961 to 1963, she worked on the <a>SAGE Project</a> at <a>Lincoln Lab</a>, where she was one of the programmers
            who wrote software for the first <a>AN/FSQ-7 computer (the XD-1)</a>, to search for
            "unfriendly" aircraft; she also wrote software for the <a>Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories</a>.</p>

          <!-- SAGE Project ------------------------------------------------------>
          <h1>SAGE Project</h1>
          <p>The SAGE Project was an extension of <a>Project Whirlwind</a>, started by <a>MIT</a>, to create a computer
            system that could predict weather systems and track their movements through simulators; <a>SAGE</a> was
            soon developed for military use in anti-aircraft air defense from potential <a>Soviet</a> attacks during the<a> Cold War</a>.
            For her part, Hamilton described her duties as such,</p>
          <p>What they used to do when you came into this organization as a beginner, was to assign you this program which
            nobody was able to ever figure out or get to run. When I was the beginner they gave it to me as well.
            And what had happened was it was tricky programming, and the person who wrote it took delight in the fact that
            all of his comments were in Greek and Latin. So I was assigned this program and I actually got it to work.
            It even printed out its answers in Latin and Greek. I was the first one to get it to work.<em class="index"><a>[10]</a></em></p>
          <p>It was her efforts on this project that made her a candidate for the position at NASA as the lead developer for Apollo flight software.</p>

          <p>Hamilton then joined the <a>Charles Stark Draper Laboratory</a> at MIT, which at the time was working
            on the Apollo space mission. She eventually led a team credited with developing the software for
            Apollo and <a>Skylab</a>.<em class="index"><a>[11]</a></em> Hamilton's team was responsible for developing in-flight software,
              <em class="index"><a>[12]</a></em>

            lunar lander, and the subsequent Skylab.<em class="index"><a>[3]</a></em><em class="index"><a>[13]</a></em> Another part of her team designed and developed
            the systems software <em class="index"><a>[14]</a></em> which included the error detection and recovery software such as restarts
            and the Display Interface Routines (AKA the Priority Displays) which Hamilton designed and
            developed.<em class="index"><a>[15]</a></em> She worked to gain hands-on experience during a time when
            computer science courses were uncommon and software engineering courses did not exist.<em class="index"><a>[3]</a></em></p>

          <p>Her areas of expertise include <a>systems design</a> and <a>software development</a>, <a>enterprise</a> and <a>process modelling</a>,

            </section>

            <p>In one of the critical moments of the <a>Apollo 11</a> mission, the <a>Apollo Guidance Computer</a>
              together with the on-board flight software averted an abort of the landing on the Moon.
              Three minutes before the <a>Lunar lander</a> reached the Moon's surface, several computer alarms
              were triggered. The computer was overloaded with interrupts caused by incorrectly phased power
              supplied to the lander's rendezvous radar.<em class="index"><a>[17]</a></em><em class="index"><a>[18]</a></em><em class="index"><a>[4]</a></em> The program alarms indicated
              "executive overflows", meaning the guidance computer could not complete
               all of its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them.<em class="index"><a>[19]</a></em>
               The asynchronous executive designed by J. Halcombe Laning <em class="index"><a>[17]</a></em><em class="index"><a>[20]</a></em>
               allowed the computer to cope with the increased demand by prioritizing tasks.
               Hamilton's priority alarm displays interrupted the astronauts' normal displays
               to warn them that there was an emergency “giving the astronauts a go/no go
               decision (to land or not to land)”.<em class="index"><a>[21]</a></em> Jack Garman, a NASA computer engineer
               in mission control, recognized the meaning of the errors that were presented to the
               astronauts by the priority displays and shouted, "Go, go!" And on they went.”<em class="index"><a>[22]</a></em> Dr.
               Paul Curto, senior technologist who nominated Hamilton for a NASA Space Act Award,
                called Hamilton's work "the foundation for ultra-reliable software design."<em class="index"><a>[14]</a></em>
                Hamilton wrote of the incident,</p>
            <p class="deeper">The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being
              asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing. It then sent out an alarm, which
              meant to the astronaut, I'm overloaded with more tasks than I should be doing at this time and
              I'm going to keep only the more important tasks; i.e., the ones needed for landing ...
               Actually, the computer was programmed to do more than recognize error conditions.
               A complete set of recovery programs was incorporated into the software. The software's action,
               in this case, was to eliminate lower priority tasks and re-establish the more important ones ...
               If the computer hadn't recognized this problem and taken recovery action,
              I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful moon landing it was.<em class="index"><a>[23]</a></em></p>
            <p class="deeper">— Letter from Margaret H. Hamilton, Director of Apollo Flight Computer

            <!-- Businesses ---------------------------------->
            <h1>Businesses</h1>

            <p>From 1976 through 1984, Hamilton was the CEO of a company she co-founded called
              Higher Order Software (HOS) to further develop ideas about error prevention and
              fault tolerance emerging from her experience at MIT.[25] They created a product
              called USE.IT, based on the HOS methodology developed at MIT.[26][27][28]
              It was successfully used in numerous government projects.[29][30]
              One notable project was to formalize and implement the first computable IDEF,
              C-IDEF for the Air Force, based on HOS as its formal foundation[citation needed].</p>
            <p>The HOS methodology garnered little interest except among
              consultants associated with the company.[31] An
              evaluation conducted by the United States Navy concluded,
              "the HOS literature tends to advertise their ideas and
              products more than making a contribution in substance to the field of
              Computer Science."[31] Edsgar Dijkstra described the USE.IT software as
              "mechanized aids for the application of obsolete techniques."[32]
              A detailed analysis of the HOS theory and AXES language was used
              by Harel to develop a derived language for a more modern form of
              structured programming derived from HOS called the And/Or programming
              language from the viewpoint of and/or subgoals.[33] Referring to
              Dijkstra's classic work on structured programming, Harel states:
               “As will become clear, the "layers" in which the program is arranged,
               these being in the heart of the idea of structured programming,
               correspond to the levels of the tree.” Harel goes on to show at
               that time how HOS and his derived And/Or programming language relates
               to mathematical logic, game theory and artificial intelligence.
               Others have used HOS to formalize the semantics of linguistic quantifiers [34]
              and to formalize the design of reliable real-time embedded systems[35]</p>
            <p>Hamilton left the company, HOS, in 1985. In March 1986, she became
              the founder and CEO of Hamilton Technologies, Inc. in
              Cambridge, Massachusetts. The company was developed around the
              Universal Systems Language (USL) and its associated automated
              environment, the 001 Tool Suite, based on her paradigm of Development
              Before The Fact (DBTF) for systems

            </section>

            <p>When Hamilton started using the term "software engineering",[39][40][41]
              software engineering was not taken seriously compared to other
              engineering; nor was it regarded as a science. She began to use the
              term "software engineering" during the early Apollo missions in order
              to give software the legitimacy of other fields such as hardware engineering.
              Over time the term "software engineering" has gained the same respect
              as any other discipline.[42] "At MIT she assisted in the creation of
              the core principles in computer programming as she worked with her
              colleagues in writing code for the world's first portable computer".
              [43] Hamilton's innovations go beyond the feats of playing an important
              role in getting man to the moon. Hamilton, along with many other female
              engineers alike, challenged the male dominated technology field of their time, to allow for
              women to enter in these STEM fields for many years to come.[44]</p>

            <h1 class="apollo">Awards</h1>

            <ul class="awards">
              <li>In 1986, she received the Augusta Ada Lovelace Award by the Association for
                Women in Computing.[6] This award is given to individuals who have excelled in either
                (or both) of two areas: 1. Outstanding scientific and technical achievement and 2.
                 Extraordinary service to the computing community through their accomplishments
                and contributions on behalf of women in computing.[45]</li>
              <li>In 2003, she was given the NASA Exceptional Space Act Award for
                scientific and technical contributions. The award included
                $37,200, the largest amount awarded to any
                individual in NASA's history.[14][46][47]</li>
              <li>In 2009, she received the Outstanding Alumni Award by Earlham College.[6]</li>
            </ul>

            <p>In addition, in 2016 a Lego minifigure of her was proposed.[48]</p>


            <!-- Personal life ------------------------------------>
            <h1>Personal life</h1>

            <p>She met her husband James Cox Hamilton while at Earlham College. They married in the late
              1950s after Heafield earned her bachelor's degree. They had a daughter together named Lauren,
              who, later in her life, married the billionaire heir, actor, dancer, and choreographer
              James Cox Chambers. During the weekends she would often take Lauren to the lab to
              spend time with her daughter and simultaneously "code away creating routines that
              would later be added to Apollo's command module computer".[43] Margaret Hamilton and James
               Cox Hamilton eventually divorced.[49]</p>
